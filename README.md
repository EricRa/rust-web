# rust-web
## A multithreaded web server written in Rust

This is the code for the final project of The Rust Book located at:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html

Starting code will mostly come from that source, and any additional code written by me is MIT licensed.
